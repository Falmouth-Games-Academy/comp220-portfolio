##Proposal:
For my concept I will create an open procedurally generated voxel based world that the player will be able to explore.

The player will be a light source that will move around the procedural world, lighting up the area around the player.

The player can fire lots of light sources that will light up the path in head.

The player can suck up all the light sources back into the player and then the player will illuminate more.
