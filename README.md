Base repository for the COMP220 assignment #1 (Portfolio of Game Engine Components)

# Proposal: 
The high concept is  walking simulator in a forest. The player can move around the forest using WASD and the goal is just to wander around and explore. In the center of the forest there will be a fire. The intended aesthetic is a dark spooky forest, as time goes on the main light source will decrease leaving just the fire near the center.

# Effects:
#### What is the effect?
The first effect will be loading in trees from a file. This will be used to create the forest itself. This will create the aesthetic as the trees are needed to create the dark and scary atmosphere.

#### What is the effect?
The second effect will be a particle effect to create the fire. The fire will be a secondary light source, the main light source will decrease over time making the fire the main light source.

#### What is the effect? - Stretch
The third effect will be collision detection. This will be a stretch goal and will be used to stop the player from walking through trees and to allow them to collect logs. This will contribute to the aesthetic as it stops players from being able to move through objects which would decrease immersive.
