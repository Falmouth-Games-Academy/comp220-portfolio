Base repository for the COMP220 assignment #1 (Portfolio of Game Engine Components)

# Proposal: 
The high concept is  walking simulator in a forest. The player can move around the forest using WASD and the goal is for the player to collect wood. Once they have enough wood they can start a fire. The intended aesthetic is a dark spooky forest, as time goes on the amount of light will decrease until it's too dark to find anymore logs.

# Effects:
#### What is the effect?
The first effect will be collision detection, this will be used to stop the player from walking through trees and to allow them to collect logs. This will contribute to the aesthetic as it allows the player to collect logs which is the goal and stops them from being able to move through objects 

#### What is the effect?
The second effect will be a particle effect to create the fire. The fire will be in the middle of the game area, once the player has collected enough logs they can start a fire.
